2 Sided linedefs that should be solid are not
Minor tears in floors and ceilings
Floor and ceiling mesh generation creates deformities on maps with bad nodes or unclosed sectors
Entities do not share the light level of their sectors
Enemies don't use doors
Loading maps with the wrong doom wad will result in missing textures
